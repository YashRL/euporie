Overview

Euporie has three sub-commands, each providing different functionality:


:doc:`Notebook Editor <edit>`
   This is an interactive TUI Jupyter Notebook editor, which runs in the terminal and allows you to view, edit and run Jupyter Notebooks.

:doc:`Notebook Preview <preview>`
   This allows you to preview notebooks without opening them in the editor. The rendered notebook output can be printed to the standard output, piped to a pager, or saved to a file. You can also run notebooks before rendering them.

:doc:`Euporie Hub <hub>`
   This allows you to run euporie as a multi-user SSH server, meaning that multiple users can share a server's resources. Each connected user is presented with the euporie editor interface, and can use it to open, run and edit notebooks.
